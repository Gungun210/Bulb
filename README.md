# 💡 Interactive Bulb Glow Project

An interactive web-based project that simulates a real-world bulb system where users can turn the bulb ON and OFF using buttons. The bulb visually glows when turned on and switches off instantly, demonstrating the practical use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and event handling.

This project highlights beginner-friendly frontend development concepts using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean and professional user interface.
